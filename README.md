## Introduction
This repository is my Java implementation of basic data structure and basic sorting algorithm. Data structure include ArrayList, LinkedList, Queue, Stack, Heap, HashTable, Trie, Binary Search Tree. Sorting Algorithm include bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort and quick sort.

## ArrayList
Implemented method:
add(E e)
add(int index)
get()
isEmpty()
remove(int index)
size()
iterator()

## Functions
* 1.User registration and authorization. New users need to confirm their accounts by email.

* 3.Users can create a new event by clicking on the map or searching for a certain location.A new event should have begin time, end time, event name, content, category and other optional information including specific location and image.

* 5.Users can register for an event and get credits after their attendance being confirmed.
* 6.Event creator can view all the users who have registered the event. And creator can also confirm the attendance of the registered user.
